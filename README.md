# tidalfields

We present Python code to calculate the tidal forces acting on a mass distribution approximated by a spherical aperture of radius R. Intended for use in cosmological simulations, but possibly applicable elsewhere.

We use this code in Frosst et al. 2025 to understand how tidal interactions between galaxies leads to bar formation. A full description of the mathematics behind this technique will be available there, upon publication.
